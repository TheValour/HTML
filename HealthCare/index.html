            <p>Medical care is something everyone needs, it can be easy to forget that medical care is a service and patients are customers. But good customer service is just as important in medicine as it is in any other field, and because people's health is so important, bad medical care or shoddy customer service might cause clients to complain to local licensing boards or engage in other actions that can harm a medical business.</p>
